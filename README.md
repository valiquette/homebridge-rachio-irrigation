# API Key

You can acquire your API key from Rachio io.app [documented here](https://rachio.readme.io/docs/authentication).

## Notes on Webhooks

`homebridge-rachio-irrigation` **requires** webhooks to update Homekit accessory status in real time such as a defined schedule from the Rachio app.


### Setting up webhooks, the easy way (if your router supports it):
 - You must know your external network IP address. [You can discover it here](https://www.myexternalip.com) to be entered in the config as the "external_Webhook_address"
 - You must enable port fowarding on your router this server is conected to. Follow you routers instructions for this set.
 - The port forwarding should look like external_webhook_port -> internal_port for your servers IP address which can be found on the Homebridge Status page in system information.
 - **NOTE:** if your IP Address is changed by your ISP, you will need to edit the IP address in the config to match it whenever it changes. You can use a Dynamic IP address DNS service if your IP changes often.

### If you cannot setup port forwarding on your router (or don't want to):
 - You must have an always-on computer available on your network (MacOS, Linux, Windows). If you're running Homebridge, you can use that one.
 - Create an account at [Webhook Relay](https://webhookrelay.com). The free account should be fine.
 - Create a new webhook relay:
   - Create a new "New Basic Forwarding" from the quickstart on the Dashboard.
   - Select _Use Default Input Domain_. Then Continue.
   - For _Destination URL_ enter: `http://127.0.0.1:27546/`
     - If you'll be installing the relay on a computer different from your Homebridge, replace the `127.0.0.1` with the IP or network name of your Homebridge server.
   - For _Output type_ choose: _Internal_
   - For _Lock destination path_ disable it so it says: _not locked_
   - Hit Continue so you're on the review step. Change your _Configuration name_ to something that makes sense for you.  I set mine to: `rachio-config`
   - Save everything by clicking on the Create Configuration button.
     - Copy the `Key`, `Secret`, and `relay CLI command` somewhere.  You'll need them later.
 - Now you'll need to install their Relay software on a computer on your network (probably wherever you have Homebridge installed). Install instructions can be [found here](https://docs.webhookrelay.com/installation-options/installation-options/install-cli).
 - Edit Settings for `homebridge-rachio-irrigation` to use the Webhook Relay
   - When setting up this plugin and you get to the _External IP Address or Domain_ section, enter the _default public endpoint_ that Webhook Relay provides you with.  It'll look like `somethinglongandrandom.hooks.webhookrelay.com`. You can find it at _Request Forwarding > Buckets_ listed under _Default public endpoint_ in the Webhook Relay dashboard.
   - Set the _External Webhook Port_ to: `80`
   - The _Internal Webhook Port_ can be left to the default `27546`. If you change it, be sure to change the _Destination URL_ in the Webhook Relay bucket settings you configured earlier.
   - Save the Config changes, and then restart Homebridge
 - Test it!
   - Make sure you're running the relay service, in Terminal or the command line, it'll look something like this: `relay forward -b rachio-config`
     - `rachio-config` should be the name of your bucket.
   - Go to `http://somethinglongandrandom.hooks.webhookrelay.com/test` in your browser and a moment later you should see in the Homebridge logs that the test was successful.
 - After you have tested everything works ok, you can make the Webhook Relay software always run by using the [instructions here](https://docs.webhookrelay.com/installation-options/installation-options/background-service).

The startup log will show if the configuration is correct and working.

If you see log messages like `Webhook received from an unknown external id`, you may set the `clear_previous_webhooks` flag to `true` to remove previous webhooks before creating or updating the webhook for this plugin. Note: this will clear all webhooks tied to your Rachio API key, so be careful if you rely on Rachio webhooks apart from this plugin.
